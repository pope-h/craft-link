  projectDescription: `We’re seeking a highly skilled and experienced tailor to bring our upcoming fashion collection to life. The project involves creating 15 bespoke pieces, including evening gowns, tailored suits, and casual wear, designed to align with the theme of elegance and contemporary style. Detailed sketches and fabric materials will be provided for each piece.
The tailor is expected to:

Follow the design specifications with precision.
Ensure high-quality stitching and finishing.
Adhere to strict measurements for a flawless fit.
Provide regular updates and allow for up to two rounds of fitting adjustments per piece.
This collection will be showcased at an exclusive launch event in Lagos next month, with opportunities for media coverage and designer recognition. Timeliness is crucial, as all pieces must be completed and ready for a final review by the specified deadline.
